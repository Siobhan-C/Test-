## Project Description
This data analysis project aims to unlock the secrets behind Pokémon evolution and its impact on stats, utilizing the rich data available through the PokeAPI. By analyzing various datasets like Evolution, Locations, Pokémon Types, and Encounters, we will answer intriguing questions and shed light on the factors influencing Pokémon strength. We will apply data analytics methods from our studies such as data cleaning, data visualization with pandas and matplotlib, python APIs, and statistical analysis on these datasets. At the end of this data analysis project, a written summary of significant findings will be submitted as well as outlined in a presentation created by the team members.

### Public data sets will be used for this data analysis project: https://pokeapi.co/.
