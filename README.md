## Project Description
This data analysis project aims to unlock the secrets behind Pokémon evolution and its impact on stats, utilizing the rich data available through the PokeAPI. By analyzing various datasets like Evolution Chains and Pokémon Types, we will answer intriguing questions and shed light on the factors influencing Pokémon strength. We will apply data analytics methods from our studies such as data cleaning, data visualization with pandas and matplotlib, python APIs, and statistical analysis on these datasets. At the end of this data analysis project, a jupyter file with significant findings will be submitted as well as outlined in a presentation created by the team members.

### Public data sets used for this data analysis project:

## Research Questions
* Which Gen 1 starter Pokémon has more success at evolving with strong stats?
* Which Gen 1 starter Pokémon have the strongest overall base stats?
* What is the strongest move for each Gen 1 starter Pokémon’s final evolution?

## Selected Datasets
* Evolution: Chains
* Pokémon: Types

## Refining Our Approach: Focusing on Gen 1 Starters with the Power of a Secure API

### Initial Scope and Challenges:
* Our initial ambition was to comprehensively analyze the entire Pokémon world. However, upon exploring the extensive datasets, we encountered two main challenges:
1. Data Diversity: Comparing Pokémon across generations proved problematic due to vast differences in abilities, stats, and evolutions, making direct comparisons across time unreliable.
2. Data Volume: The sheer amount of data encompassing all Pokémon types, evolutions, and moves was overwhelming and challenging to handle efficiently.
   
### Revised Approach and Leveraging a Secure API:
* To overcome these challenges and conduct a focused analysis, we strategically redefined our scope. We decided to investigate the well-loved Gen 1 starter Pokémon:
1. Charmander: The fiery lizard
2. Squirtle: The shelled water turtle
3. Bulbasaur: The grass/poison dinosaur
* This decision narrowed our focus to 9 Pokémon: the three starters and their respective first and second evolutions.
* Furthermore, to efficiently acquire and manipulate the vast amount of Pokémon data, we utilized a secure API (Application Programming Interface).
* This powerful tool provided easy access to the PokeAPI, a public API specifically designed for accessing Pokémon data.
* Importantly, the PokeAPI does not require passwords, ensuring a secure and streamlined data retrieval process.
* By leveraging the API, we seamlessly retrieved and processed the relevant information, successfully avoiding any issues with this step.
* This allowed us to concentrate our efforts on analyzing the data and extracting meaningful insights.

### Data Processing with JSON:
* For efficient data processing, we utilized JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
* This widely used format effectively organizes and structures the retrieved data, making it easily accessible and usable for our analysis tools.

### Adapting Research Questions:
* Through initial data exploration, we realized that some of our initial research questions would yield identical answers for all three Gen 1 starters.
* To avoid redundancy and present interesting insights, we refined our questions to highlight the nuances within the chosen dataset.

### Outcome:
* By pivoting our approach, focusing on Gen 1 starters, utilizing a secure API, and processing data with JSON, we developed a more focused, efficient, and engaging analysis.
* The specific revisions to our research questions are detailed in the following slides.

### Key Takeaways:
* Starting broad can be valuable for exploration, but refining the scope based on data characteristics and employing tools like secure APIs leads to more focused and insightful analysis.
* Tailoring research questions to leverage the unique features of the chosen dataset ensures interesting and relevant findings.
